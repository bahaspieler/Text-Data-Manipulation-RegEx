# Text Data Manipulation
Text files data format or arrangement isn't always convenient to put in a excel file for further analysis.
It consumes much time for parsing a huge _text file_ manually or shaping the text file to an excel.

So here is a script to work with two text files to retrieve necessary information and put that information
in a desired place _**automatically**_. It does the work in the blink of an eye, that would take way more time to 
do manually.


## Quick Start
* Git clone this repository or download the zip file. At the extracted folder, open cmd/terminal and execute the below
command.

`python data_manipulation.py`

* See the generated output file in the `Text files` folder and observe the changes that has just made.
